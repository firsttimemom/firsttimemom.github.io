Part 3 of looking for friends but now I wonder if I’m just looking in or around the wrong places? Am I hoping to find the perfect group of mom’s, preferably from my home country (I wish) or maybe moms who might be a bit friendlier or just who seem to be interested in having some form of contact. I understand that I’m probably asking too much and maybe, just maybe my idea of this perfect mom’s group and/or friendly people is just a very far dream. 

But let’s get back to more evidence that perhaps it is me after all, or rather us (my husband and I).
