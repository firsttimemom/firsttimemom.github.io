Like every mom to be during pregnancy, for the longest time, you spend time researching different carriers and wraps which will hopefully suit your wants and needs especially when you have a certain image in mine. 

My image had always been a cotton or t-shirt fabric styled wrap but could never find one while looking on the interwebs. What this meant for me was that my search would bring me back many results but never something that was cotton styled or made of fabric as soft as a t-shirt but also stretchy. I mean my requirements were simple, I wanted a long piece of stretchy t-shirt fabric that I could wrap around me and it would be strong enough to hold my baby while I do things with one hand while I worry if it’s strong enough to hold the 3.2kgs I ejected a few weeks ago.

Now a few weeks later, honestly not even 3 weeks later, I have used what I’ve found a whole 2 times, and it’s not for the lack of trying but more of the lack of a cooperating baby who doesn’t want to be in a side position against my chest while his umbilical cord does it’s thang of getting dry enough to fall off. So I will wrap the wrap around me, plop him in (in a much nicer way I promise) have him squirm a bit as he adjusts to the position, my skin and my movements while he is in it. Eventually the little angel will settle from being a squirmy sour worm just as you put him in, and now I think I can do things but still wonder if I actually can do things while feeling confident that I’ve tied the wrap tight enough to not need to hold the outside while moving around and doing things. 

Now I have seen many videos and TikTok’s with both mothers and fathers putting on the wrap, strapping their mini versions in it and then going about their business with a baby on the chest, but also what seems like a very snug wrap. My question is, how snug should snug really be? Is there a limit to the snug? There is a too loose version of wrapping the wrap on you, and that should be avoided unless the child is snug within it for it’s age and other factors which currently don’t apply to me but I can’t help worry that I’ve tightened it enough but also left it loose enough that the baby doesn’t feel too confined while in it against my skin. 

Am I the only one who thinks about these thoughts? Am I over thinking things because I’ve already thought of the worst instead of thinking of the liberating feeling of being able to do some chores while having a sleeping baby on the chest. And am I the only one who is literally wearing the wrap like a t-shirt using it as a moment to do skin on skin with the baby. Does it count as skin to skin if you’re not sitting still while the baby is on your chest?

Sincerely yours
